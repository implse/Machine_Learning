# Machine Learning


Machine Learning is the science of programming computers so they can learn from data.


## Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms

__Supervised Learning__ : data is labeled and the program learns to predict the output from the input data.

__Unsupervised Learning__ : data is unlabeled and the program learns to recognize the inherent structure in the input data

## Regression vs Classification

Supervised learning problems can be further grouped into regression and classification problems.

  - __Regression__ : A regression problem is when the output variable is a real value, such as “dollars” or “weight”.

  - __Classification__ : A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as “red” or “blue” or “disease” and “no disease”.



Some popular examples of supervised machine learning algorithms are:

  - Linear regression for regression problems.
  - Random forest for classification and regression problems.
  - Support vector machines for classification problems.
